### Filter Tweet Metadata
* The file `filter_tweet_metadata.py` extracts the metadata for every tweet in the tweet_dump file and writes them onto a CSV file (in an organized way).
* The code was written in `python2` and can be run using the command `python filter_tweet_metadata.py <TWEET_DUMP_FILEPATH>`
* **Input file format:**
	* The code assumes that every line if the input file contains the JSON dump of a tweet (obtained from the Twarc module - described in `tweet_extraction` module).
	* **E.g.** Line 1 of the input file contains `{'tweet_id': 123456789, ....}` which is the JSON dump of the tweet with tweet_id `123456789`.
* **Output file format:**
	* The output file has the filename `<TWEET_DUMP_FILENAME>_metadata.csv` (The TWEET_DUMP_FILENAME containing the tweet dump is extracted automatically from the filepath).
	* The output CSV file has the following columns:
		* `tweet_id` - Tweet ID
		* `tweet_date` - Tweet posted date
		* `tweet_favCount` - Favourite count for the tweet (till the time tweet was extracted using Twitter API)
